eternity
========

## Description
A date/time detection and management module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey).

## Installation
This module is officially available from the [Regal Modules](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/regal-modules#regal-modules) project, and may be installed by following the installation guide provided with that repository.

Although this can be installed with the Regal Modules, this particular module does not require the other modules under normal circumstances. Although this is true, future revisions may change this behavior.

Currently, the only requirements this module has are covered by the ["standard library"](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/tree/develop/modules) provided with Monkey, however when using a non-game-target, this module reserves the right to use modules from the 'regal' namespace.

Import syntax varies with usage, with the official distribution using 'regal' as a parent namespace. (e.g. regal.eternity)
